## Remake Plot Competition

Welcome to the "Remake Plot" competition, a unique challenge that unfolds every week. In this competition, I will post an image along with its corresponding data. Your task is to recreate the plot using the provided data. This is a fantastic opportunity to test your data visualization skills and creativity.

Here's the exciting part - there's a reward for your effort! The competition runs until Friday at 3:30 PM. The participant who submits the most accurate recreation the earliest will be declared the winner. And the prize? A gift card to Starbucks! So, get your data tools ready and let the plotting begin!
